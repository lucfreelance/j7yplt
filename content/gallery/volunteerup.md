### Summary
VolunteerUp is a Ruby on Rails app that connects volunteers with non-profit organizations. It was built in a 2-week sprint on a team of 7 developers as a final project during the LEARN Academy full-stack Ruby on Rails course. My primary involvement was developing the component for searching and filtering organizations and events within the application as well as some UI/UX guidance.
