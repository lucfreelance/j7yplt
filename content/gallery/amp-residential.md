### Summary
One of my largest projects came in the fall of 2018 with AMP Residential, a property management company whose goal was to launch an entire suite of websites for a portfolio of 30+ multifamily properties. A theme requiring extensive customization capabilities to fit the different needs of all properties and their websites was needed.

The design was challenging because of several offset elements that needed repositioning and resizing for different viewports and many sections demanded conditionality to fit the content of each site, but it was a fun puzzle to solve. It's become a favorite build of mine.

Some of the sites built with this theme include [RiverFront Towers](https://www.ampresidential.com/riverfront-towers-detroit-mi), [Stone Ridge Apartments](https://www.ampresidential.com/stone-ridge-indianapolis-in/), and [Woodland Creek Apartments](https://www.ampresidential.com/woodland-creek-kentwood-mi/).
