### Summary
Avenue5 Residential is a multifamily property management company with 40,000 units and 200 properties across the United States. Although they sustained a large online presence, a number of their properties websites were in need of fresh, updated design and functionality. In early 2018, I developed a custom site theme that was applied to a number of websites under their portfolio of properties that was moved to a Ruby on Rails platform.

Two of the property sites undergoing transformation included [Boulder Canyon](https://www.liveatbouldercanyon.com/boulder-canyon-west-jordan-ut/) and [Canyon View](https://www.liveatcanyonview.com/canyon-view-orem-ut/).
