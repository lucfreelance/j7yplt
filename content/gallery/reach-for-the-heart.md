### Summary
Reach for the Heart is the website behind a heart valve disease awareness campaign. The site presents the user with information about heart valve disease, how to recognize symptoms, and how to get a full diagnosis and treatment if the disease is present.

One of the main features of the site is the interactive questionnaire in which a user can answer a few questions about themselves or on behalf of a loved one to help recognize the presence of heart valve disease. A personalized discussion guide PDF is then generated based on the user's answers which can help start a conversation with a doctor.

Extensive accessibility considerations were put into the project to help ensure that elderly and disabled users could effortlessly navigate the site and read the information. Search engine optimization and tracking through Google Tag Manager was implemented to help gather data about how users were interacting with the website and what type of improvements could be made to help users reach necessary information.
