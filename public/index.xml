      <description>Summary Cason Lane needed a revamped digital calling card for his business communications consultancy. Main client concerns included site rendering speed, search engine optimization, security, and a new design that maintained the recognizable brand image.
A transition was made from a slow-loading and clunky Wordpress theme to a modern and clean custom site design that was developed with Hugo, a static site generator. Swapping the unnecessarily heavyweight Wordpress CMS along with its slow-loading database and plethora of plugins for a static site greatly helped reduce page load speeds from 20+ seconds to under 1 or 2 seconds.</description>

      <description>Summary Lincoln Property Company is the second largest property management company in the US with over 184,000 units under management. In late 2018, I developed an interactive infographic that presents the current state of consumer trends and behaviors in an easily digestible manner.
The infographic displays digital marketing statistics about sourced from a variety of sources. The information is displayed with eye-catching animations that are initiated by a user&amp;rsquo;s scroll behavior.</description>

      <title>Displaying a List of Git Conflicts</title>

      <guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/displaying-a-list-of-git-conflicts/</guid>
      <description>Working in a large code base with many other developers can lead to instances of merge conflicts. Merge conflicts happen when two branches modify the same lines of code and git can&amp;rsquo;t resolve which changes to keep.
Typically, git is pretty good with merging distinctly separate work together up to this point, when merge conflicts arise and require human intervention. When that happens, git will alert you in the terminal with a message that looks like this:</description>

      <guid>https://tomanistor.com/gallery/amp-residential/</guid>
      <description>Summary One of my largest projects came in the fall of 2018 with AMP Residential, a property management company whose goal was to launch an entire suite of websites for a portfolio of 30+ multifamily properties. A theme requiring extensive customization capabilities to fit the different needs of all properties and their websites was needed.
The design was challenging because of several offset elements that needed repositioning and resizing for different viewports and many sections demanded conditionality to fit the content of each site, but it was a fun puzzle to solve.</description>

      <description> Summary Morada Plano is a luxury apartment complex located in the Plano Arts District and Historic Downtown Plano. In the summer of 2018, I developed another custom property site for Southern Land Company.
For this build, I implemented new UX features requested by the client and designer like parallax scrolling, SVG animations, counter animations, and an Instagram feed.

      <description>Summary Avenue5 Residential is a multifamily property management company with 40,000 units and 200 properties across the United States. Although they sustained a large online presence, a number of their properties websites were in need of fresh, updated design and functionality. In early 2018, I developed a custom site theme that was applied to a number of websites under their portfolio of properties that was moved to a Ruby on Rails platform.</description>

      <title>Selecting and Modifying CSS Pseudo-Elements with JavaScript</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 19:59:16 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/selecting-and-modifying-css-pseudo-elements-with-javascript/</guid>
      <description>Since they&amp;rsquo;re not part of the DOM, CSS pseudo-elements can&amp;rsquo;t be selected and edited with JavaScript the same way as traditional elements on a page. I ended up going a different route by selecting the regular elements, creating CSS rules for their pseudo elements, and injecting those them into the page.
The Design One of my recent projects involved creating 10 sections that follow a similar layout. Each section was distinguished by a numbered tab that was incrementally offset to the right of the previous section&amp;rsquo;s tab.</description>

      <description>Untracked files are files in the git repository&amp;rsquo;s working tree that are not present in the git index. These are new files that were not present in the previous snapshot of the repository.
When you don&amp;rsquo;t want to stage and commit these files, git clean is a useful way to permanently remove all or a selection of your untracked files in git.
This is what untracked files look like when using git status</description>

      <description>One of my recent site builds came back from a round of QA with a bug present only on mobile iOS devices. It was a set of tab links that required two clicks to function on iPhones and iPads.
The Bug The buggy tab links had an effect that added a pseudo element to the right of each link indicating when a link was hovered over, in focus, or active.</description>

      <description>Around the time I graduated from my programming bootcamp in March 2017, I started listening to programming podcasts to scratch the itch of continuous learning and to keep myself engaged with the world of web development.
Although I started with just a handful, almost a third of my Podcast Addict app is now filled with them. Some are more specific to a programming niche, tech stack, languages, or frameworks while others are broad and all-encompassing.</description>

      <title>My First Vue.js App</title>
      <link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/my-first-vuejs-app/</link>

      <guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/my-first-vuejs-app/</guid>
      <description>A little while ago, I spent some time researching which frontend JavaScript framework or library I would learn next. The primary criteria was ease of learning, ease of use, and popularity (community support and career usefulness). I chose to start with Vue.js.
My method of learning was by reading the Vue.js documentation and following Ayo Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for developing a to-do list application. The former was very helpful in introducing me to concepts and the latter was even more helpful in explaining those concepts in practice.</description>

      <title>Const, Let, and Var</title>

      <guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/const-let-and-var/</guid>
      <description>One of the very first things I noticed when I took up JavaScript ECMAScript 2015, or more commonly known as ES6, were the new types of variable declarations. Whereas I had previously only used var to declare a variable, I could now declare variables using let and const.
But how are let and const different from var? And in what situations are they each appropriate to use?
Scope Each of the the three variable declarations deal with different levels of scope: global, function, and block level scopes.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little indecisive on which JavaScript framework or library to dive into next. Based on all of the job descriptions I&amp;rsquo;ve been plowing through, any front-end and even most full-stack web development roles require proficiency with a number of different JavaScript frameworks.
Vanilla JavaScript is Not Enough A lot of advice directed at junior web developers that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online stresses the importance of mastering JavaScript before attempting to level up with frameworks.</description>

      <description>Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files are normally cached for long periods of time with expiry periods of a few weeks or months after being served to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. Caching is used to speed up a website or application by once downloading a file and storing a cached version of it in the browser. When a user moves from page to page on a website or revisits the same site in the future, the cached file is served automatically without wasting any time loading the same file.</description>

Purge and Serve To generate a new public/ folder, just remove the existing one and run the server. All updates you have made to your content and theme are now available in the new public/ folder and visible on the live server.</description>
